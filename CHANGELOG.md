## 0.4.0

- Added some more icons from useanimations.com

## 0.3.0

- Added media and content icons from useanimations.com
- Corrected the example in README.md
- updated lottie dependency to 3.0.0-alpha.3

## 0.2.0

- Added some more icons from useanimations.com
- Added an example directory
- Forgot to add package name for loading the lottie assets, so it was not possible to use the package in other projects. This is fixed now.

## 0.1.1

Just replaced the mp4 showcases with gif files, so they can be seen on pub.dev without clicking on them.

## 0.1.0

Most basic icons from useanimations.com are added, but still some are missing. I will add them a little later.
Also the energy consumption can be improved by using lottie 3.0, but currently it is still in alpha, so we will
wait a little bit until it becomes more stable.

## 0.1.1

Just replaced the mp4 showcases with gif files, so they can be seen on pub.dev without clicking on them.

## 0.1.0

Most basic icons from useanimations.com are added, but still some are missing. I will add them a little later.
Also the energy consumption can be improved by using lottie 3.0, but currently it is still in alpha, so we will
wait a little bit until it becomes more stable.
